TODO: 

Add a scatter() function which immediately distributes all the (remaining) alarms on empty spaces somewhat evenly across all floors - it's quite time-consuming to add 15 or 18 alarm tiles and 4 cameras.

Add a full randomLayout() which immediately distributes all the remaining tiles on empty spaces, obeying enabled rules.

Allow rules to be disabled (e.g. allow more than one safe per floor).

Allow custom distributions of tiles.
