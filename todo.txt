TODO: 

Space out floors according to their dim not some hardcoded idea of floor dim.

Allow rules to be disabled (e.g. allow more than one safe per floor).

Allow custom distributions of tiles.

DONE:

Add a full randomLayout() which immediately distributes all the remaining tiles on empty spaces.

Have the full random distribution obey enabled rules.

UI: help the user identify which tile-types have not been exhausted.  It's difficult to see.  Perhaps gray out used tiles, or have any non-zero remain count be much more visible than zero remaining.
